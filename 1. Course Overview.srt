00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:10,510
Hello everyone and welcome to the computer vision of Python an open C-v course and this lecture going

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,480
to have a quick course overview.

3
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,720
I have a favor to ask of you and it's Please don't skip this lecture.

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,990
I know a lot of times people want to jump ahead to the really cool material but it's going to be a few

5
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,590
housekeeping items that are really important to the Course here.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,380
So if you've taken other courses of mine before please don't skip this lecture.

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,720
There's a few important points that are different than other courses.

8
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:30,190
OK.

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,440
So to quickly go over everything we're going to talk about.

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,160
Useful Tips for going through the course how to get help during the course.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,990
Some advice how to approach the course or to find the actual course notebooks and code and how to use

12
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,250
the student chat channel.

13
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,970
So a couple of useful tips right off the bat.

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,580
I tend to speak at a pretty steady pace.

15
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:53,450
However maybe English isn't your first language so you want to slow down the videos or you actually

16
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,810
prefer to watch videos at a higher speed like I do.

17
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:00,770
You can use the video player settings at the bottom of your video player to speed up or slow down the

18
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,460
videos.

19
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,890
If you want to download the videos you can use the Official you Timmy app to do so.

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,130
Also please make sure to make use of her question answer forums.

21
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,150
There's lots of previous discussion available there.

22
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:16,160
Since we have thousands of students now let's talk about getting help.

23
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,300
If you have any issue with things that are platform level those are things like issues of video play

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:27,470
back or logging in getting your actual certification for the course or issues with payments or sales

25
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,400
discounts.

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,750
Please e-mail support you to me dot com.

27
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,700
Those are you to me platform level issues and we actually don't have control over that.

28
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:40,310
So the best way to get help is to email support at me dot com or to directly open a support ticket with

29
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,760
them.

30
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,700
Now let's talk about getting help in regards to the Course material.

31
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,400
A couple of quick tips is you should always double check against the course note books that we provide

32
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,740
and it's always a good idea to do a quick google or stack overflow search.

33
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,610
Often if you just Google search the error code you're getting the very first hit will be a stack overflow

34
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,290
post with the answer you're looking for.

35
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,210
So that's a really fast way to get an answer.

36
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,030
Often I reply to Q&amp;A forums where Stack Overflow leaks.

37
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,780
Now you should also do a search on the Kewaunee forums in the course questions come up often more than

38
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,120
once and they'll already be answered for you in the question.

39
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,190
Answer forms by previous students.

40
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,180
You may also want to check out the Frequently Asked Questions lecture which is the next lecture right

41
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,380
after this one.

42
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,880
Now if all of that doesn't work for you you can always submit a new question in the question answer

43
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,600
forms please include details on what you've tried.

44
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,760
And a screenshot of your error code.

45
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:39,230
One quick tip before posting to the Q&amp;A forums please confirm that you're using our provided environment

46
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,650
which we set up in the course setup an installation lecture and that you've tried running our provided

47
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,850
notebooks in that provided environment.

48
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,420
Theoretically if you're running our provided notebooks directly in our provided environment you shouldn't

49
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,410
receive any errors whatsoever.

50
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,910
Often simple typos can cause errors especially for trying to type as you're watching videos.

51
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:03,410
So if you run the two steps above that will avoid any typos and your code should always run flawlessly.

52
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:07,760
Please keep in mind that we cannot help with your personal computer vision projects outside of the Course

53
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,410
questions of course material.

54
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,640
However this court chat channel is a great place to share your questions on your personal projects.

55
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,860
You can use the link in the automated welcome message to join our discourse server where we have that

56
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,180
student chat channel.

57
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,890
The automated welcome message that you receive when enrolling in this course also includes a link to

58
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:34,540
a YouTube video describing how to use and log in to the test server as far as the best way to approach

59
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,520
this course.

60
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,890
I recommend that you take a two pronged approach.

61
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,600
One is that you study the notebooks that contain the code used in every lecture and keep in mind that

62
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,000
organized in the same order they appear in the course of their all number and then the video and slides

63
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,320
from the actual course video platform.

64
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,830
Those usually contain explanatory concepts that can't really be shown through code so a lot of computer

65
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,210
vision.

66
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,780
It's a little hard to display impure code so we have some slides and some extra explanations in the

67
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,120
videos that you may not find in the code books.

68
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:11,030
So you want to take both approaches seriously as far as the Course notebooks those can be found as resource

69
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,670
links indiv AFAIK.

70
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,470
Lecture.

71
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:19,220
Keep in mind the very couple last sections on deep learning they do require some additional larger downloads

72
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,870
that aren't found in the zip file but the videos in that section of course will actually provide further

73
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,410
details on that data.

74
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,700
So you have to do a couple of extra downloads when you get to the deep learning section.

75
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:34,880
Just because there are some really large files to download Now keep in mind for that student chat channel.

76
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,200
The purpose of that chat channel to connect with students of other students and technical questions

77
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,630
related to the course material are best suited for the Q&amp;A forums.

78
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,290
OK so that's it.

79
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,630
Hope it didn't take too long.

80
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,340
And thank you so much for enrolling this course.

81
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,780
And I'm super excited to start your journey in computer vision.

82
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,920
We'll see you at the next lecture.
